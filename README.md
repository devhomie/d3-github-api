# Visualizing Data from the Github Search API

 - Build an application that reads data from a public API
   and uses D3 to build an interactive bar chart based on that data.
 - We'll be reading data from the GitHub Search API.
   - This API allows you to search for data on GitHub, a service that
     hosts Git repositories. -- Git is a popular version control system
     for keeping track of software project source code.
   - The API uses the HTTPS protocol and returns JSON-formatted data
     based on a search query you encode into a URL.
